"""End-to-end tests for Macela Bot.

These tests use aiogram-test-framework to simulate user interactions
with the bot in a fully mocked environment (MongoDB via mongomock, Redis via fakeredis).

Note: aiogram-test-framework primarily supports private chat testing.
Group chat testing would require manual message construction.
